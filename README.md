# Bucharest Trail

**Technologies:** React, Tailwind CSS, Google Maps Platform (Maps JavaScript API, Places & Autocomplete, Directions, Geocoding)

---

## Inspiration

While traveling, I once had several hours to spare before my check-in. I wanted to explore the city, but ended up zigzagging and revisiting areas because I hadn’t planned a smart route. That frustration sparked the idea for Bucharest Trail: an app to help travelers explore more efficiently and feel like locals, even on a tight schedule.

## What It Does

Bucharest Trail generates optimized walking routes between two locations in Bucharest. Along the way, users can add curated points of interest (POIs) tailored to categories like parks, cafés, museums, or relaxation spots. The app updates walking time in real-time and allows users to launch their final route directly in Google Maps.

## How I Built It

The app is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It integrates multiple Google Maps Platform APIs, including:

- Maps JavaScript API (interactive map)  
- Places & Autocomplete APIs (search + POI metadata)  
- Directions API (route optimization)  
- Geocoding API (address conversion)  

## Challenges & Accomplishments

The main challenge was the short timeline—I discovered the Google Maps Platform Awards just days before the deadline. Having used one of the APIs before, I saw this as an opportunity to challenge myself with a full solo submission and to learn React, which was new to me.

## What’s Next

I plan to extend Bucharest Trail to work for any city by automatically selecting popular spots based on reviews and user ratings. I also want to add real-time info like opening hours and crowd levels.

Other upcoming features include:

- A points and rewards system to gamify exploration  
- A digital passport showcasing badges like visiting the top museums or parks  
- Improved mobile responsiveness for on-the-go use
